Leave a message is an alexa skill that allows users to leave voice messages that can be recorded and heard by others around the world.

All profanity is replaced by fart sounds.

Three commands:
Alexa, ask leave a message to save "hello, how are you?"
Alexa, ask leave a message to get the last message / for a message.
Alexa, ask leave a message for how many times my message has been heard.
